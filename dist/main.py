# main_k — FAST-KILL elimination overlay on top of 14_4c
# ============================================================
# Goal: ELIMINATE one enemy at a time as fast as possible.
# - 2P: target the single enemy (focus_enemy_2p already in 14_4c).
# - 4P: pick a focus_enemy_4p = enemy currently attacking us most (their
#   bases are stripped, easy targets) OR weakest with reachable planets if
#   nobody is actively attacking.
#
# Dedicated handler `handle_eliminate_focus` runs AFTER expand and BEFORE
# hammer. For each focus-enemy planet (sorted easiest-first), it finds the
# closest source able to solo it and fires. This guarantees we attempt at
# least one elimination strike per turn regardless of expand's scoring.

#          attacker_threshold (now: max(20, my_prod * 8))
# 4P focus picker: prefer enemy that's attacking us. Falls back to weakest
# reachable. Avoid finishing the absolute weakest if doing so makes a leader
# dominant — using state-derived kingmaker check (leader_prod > my_prod*1.5).

# K2 (intel-aware decision gates, 4P-only):
# - Don't drain a friendly source on NEUTRAL expansion when that source is the
#   closest defender to one of OUR planets currently under heavy attack. Saves
#   it for next-turn reinforcement (matches user's "send ships to neutral when
#   a planet wants support" mistake).
# - Use enemy_planet_attackers info: when an enemy planet is under attack by
#   ANOTHER enemy, it's a softer target — boost in expand ranking, tighten
#   reactive-emit estimate in eliminate-focus (those ships defend instead).

#   ALL stop_expand gates so neutrals are always allowed. Production-starvation
#   = elimination spiral. The floor scales with map size and player count.
# - K3-B: drop the my_planets < 3 hard gate in handle_eliminate_focus. The
#   per-source `avail < required` check inside the loop already prevents
#   wasted strikes when we have no surplus.
# - K3-C: exposure-aware max_fires — smooth interpolation of max_fires from
#   1/3 of idle (at 0% exposure) to ALL idle (at 100% exposure). No magic
